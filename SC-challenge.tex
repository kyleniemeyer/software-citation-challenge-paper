\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Modern science and engineering depend on software.
We use citation to acknowledge traditional research results published in archival journals and conferences, but no such accepted standard exists to credit the considerable efforts that go into software.
One method to increase the amount of software developed, shared, and credited is to treat a software release as a publication.\knnote{Dan: can you support this statement with a citation?} 
In addition, since research results, including data, now depend on the specific software used (e.g., version), proper citation---and the associated preservation---is necessary to ensure reproducibility.
\textbf{The main challenge of software citation is that we need a way to uniquely identify released\slash published software so that it can be cited by others who use it.}
We also need a process to curate and review software.

\knnote{introduce connection to data quality\slash information quality here}
Data provenance requires, among other things, record of software used to generate or process that data~\cite{Wilson:2014aa}.

Different communities follow widely varying practices for citing software, with guidelines ranging from citations of an associated paper or the software itself via DOI~\cite{AAS:2016} to no policy at all, with many ad hoc practices in between~\cite{Howison2015}.
%Furthermore, some research communities have not yet adopted open-source mentalities regarding research software.
Questions also remain about the role of curating\slash reviewing software---if software will be cited in the same manner as a publication, is quality assessment needed (e.g., peer code review)?
If so, how, when, and by whom?

As a first step towards sustainable, reusable, and attributable software, efforts are underway to establish citation practices for software used in research.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Related Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Multiple organizations, including the WSSSPE Software Credit~\cite{WSSSPE1,WSSSPE2,WSSSPE3} and FORCE11 Software Citation Working Groups, are working to standardize software citation practices.
Some of the observations and recommendations made here come from their efforts, which follow similar work by DataCite and the FORCE11~\citeN{DataCitation2014} to standardize research data citation practices.
Currently, services including Zenodo or fig\textbf{share} allow software developers to obtain DOIs for software; the former has a streamlined process~\cite{GitHubZenodo} to register DOIs for GitHub software releases.
The CodeMeta project~\cite{CodeMeta} is formalizing minimal metadata schemas in JSON and XML to connect existing software repositories, archives, and libraries (e.g., GitHub, fig\textbf{share}, Zenodo).

\knnote{mention workshops on software citation; University of Manchester (? can't actually find that one). Additional references are good.} \katznote{\url{https://softwaredatacitation.org/}  \url{http://www.software.ac.uk/software-credit} maybe \url{http://software.ac.uk/maintainable-software-practice-workshop}} \katznote{Arfon, are the more that showed up in related work in the software citation activity?}

Complementary efforts to provide credit for software development in research also depend on standardized citation practices.
These include the transitive credit via JSON-LD scheme~\cite{Katz:2015aa} that assigns varying credit weights to contriponents---both contributors and research artifacts, including software and data---depending on their level of importance to the work.
The Project CRediT (contributor role taxonomy) scheme~\cite{project_credit} includes a ``software'' category for authors of a publication with roles dedicated to software development, maintenance, and\slash or testing.
The related PaperBadger project~\cite{PaperBadger} offers digital contributor badges associated with each role, connecting publications with people via DOI and ORCID, respectively.

\knnote{suggest ``few possible answers or clear path that might be followed''} \katznote{tried to start in table}

For software to be cited, we recommend that metadata include software name, primary authors\slash contributors (name and ORCID), DOI or other unique identifier, location where the software has been published\slash archived (DOI\slash URL), and software dependencies (via DOI).
This information should be provided in a CITATION file, potentially in JSON or XML format (and with an appropriate metadata schema, e.g., DOAP) to replace or supplement plaintext and allow automatic processing.
Citations of software in publications should minimally include software name, primary authors, and DOI or location where the software was published\slash archived; however, individual citation formats will vary based on the particular style of journals, conferences, or professional societies.
Existing services such as Libraries.io~\cite{Libraries.io} and Depsy~\cite{Depsy} automate software dependency tracking; these could be harnessed to produce citation networks.
Technical solutions to these challenges exist; community acceptance is instead needed.

\knnote{add discussion of when software should be cited; mention F11 principles}
Question of when software should be cited; although no clear answer, in order to ensure reproducibility of research results, software should be cited if used directly and important to the results.
In other words, if using different software could produce different data or results, then the software used should be cited.

\katznote{done below - feel free to edit} The authors of this paper are currently leading
a working group under FORCE11 to develop principles for software citation~\cite{SCWG}.  The draft principles document~\cite{SoftwareCitation2016}, which is adapted from an earlier set of principles for data citation~\cite{DataCitation2014}, discusses
how the decision on what software to cite should be made.  It currently states:

\begin{quote}
What software should be cited is the decision of the author(s) of the research work, in the context of community norms and practices, and in most scientific communities, these are currently in flux.
In general, we believe that any software on which a research product directly depends should be cited, if it significantly contributes to the research product.
Again, the specific decision of what is significant must be made by the author(s) of the product.
However, an illustrative example is the use of Microsoft Excel in research.
We suggest that if Excel is used to simply store and plot data, it does not need to be cited, but if it is used for statistical analysis, it should be.  Similarly, general software for conducting library research (e.g., JSTOR Mobile App), writing research papers (e.g., \LaTeX), scientific presentations (e.g., Powerpoint) or communications (e.g., Skype) should not be cited.
This recommendation matches that of the Purdue Online Writing Lab: ``Do not cite standard office software (e.g. Word, Excel) or programming languages.  Provide references only for specialized software.''~\cite{powl-citing-software}

Note that some software which is or could be captured as part of data provenance may not be cited.
Citation is a record of software that is important to the research outcome, where provenance is a record of all steps (including software) used to generated particular data within the research process.
This implies that for a data research product, provenance data will include all cited software, but not necessarily vice versa.
Similarly, the software metadata that is recorded as part of data provenance should be a superset of the metadata recorded as part of software citation.
And the data recorded for reproducibility should also be a superset of the metadata recorded as part of software citation.
These statements may also be true for software products.
In general, we intend the software citation principles to cover the minimum of what is necessary for software citation for the purpose of software identification.
Other use cases (e.g., provenance, reproducibility) may lead to additional requirements (i.e., enhanced metadata).
\end{quote}



However, research and development efforts are needed to solve the remaining challenges.
These questions include: how can we cite closed-source\slash commercial software---can the above information be provided, even if the the software itself is not publicly preserved?
How will index services (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar) fully index software, since software citations require indexing to create a citation network akin to publications to carry weight for academic credit and reputation?
How can publications indicate direct use of software for research in citations, where results would not be possible without efforts of software authors---should such a citation be ``weighted'' higher than others?
The \citeN{AAS:2016} suggests a new ``Software'' section below the acknowledgements; other approaches include machine-readable supplementary data~\cite{Katz:2015aa}.

Finally, open questions remain on whether citable software should go through peer review and, if so, how can this be implemented?
Should citable software itself follow the arXiv preprint model where releases are made available for users and the community to judge, or alternatively, the software paper model where ``advertising'' papers undergo peer review in a relevant community?
