### Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:

#### Reviewer: 1

**Recommendation**: Major Revision

**Comments**:

This challenge paper point out some key challenges and research directions in the context of software citation.
This is an interesting topic and authors highlight important concerns about software citation and summarize the scope of the problem providing, however, few possible answers or a clear path that might be followed.
Also, the discussion can go deeper other than ways to cite software. In cases where software is not the focus of the research should it even be cited? For instance, in a data analysis scenario, does it makes sense to cite a particular implementation of an algorithm? Should Pearson be cited in the references section when a correlation analysis is performed?


**Additional Questions:**

1. Relevance to Data and Information Quality: high

2. Significant Contribution with Originality/Novelty: marginal

3. Grounded in Theory and Literature: high

4. Use of appropriate Research Method and Approach: high

5. Readability and Organization: high

Most ACM journal papers are researcher-oriented. Is this paper of potential interest to developers and engineers?: Maybe

**Comments:**

one method to increase...  who suggests this? (yourself, or should there be a reference here).

software citation is indeed as important as article or data citation.  The connection with DQ/IQ seems a bit tenuous, however. I am sure the connection can be made, for instance the ability to do all the things promised in the title relies upon good quality and complete metadata. 
However I was rather hoping the authors would elaborate on this connection?

I am aware of at least one recent workshop on software citation (organised at the University of Manchester in the UK), so the topic is clearly on the table. On this note, I would suggest the authors may want to frame the related work discussion in the context of the challenges, as it seems to be work (for the most part, it's not research) aimed at meeting some of those challenges.

there are 5 bibliography entries in the references (ie proper publications), and 4 are self-citations. I find this rather unbalanced.
